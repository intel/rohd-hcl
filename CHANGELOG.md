## 0.2.0

- Added extensive variable-width floating-point support:

- Added `CompoundAdder` and `CarrySelectOnesComplement` adder components (<https://github.com/intel/rohd-hcl/pull/98>), (<https://github.com/intel/rohd-hcl/pull/178>).
- Added extensive integer multiplication support:
  - Added multiplier componentry such as parameterizable Booth-encoders, different kinds of sign extension on a partial-product array, delay-driven Wallace tree compression, and selection of differnt kinds for final adders (<https://github.com/intel/rohd-hcl/pull/85>).
