# ROHD Hardware Component Libary

A hardware component library developed with [ROHD](https://github.com/intel/rohd).  This library aims to collect a set of reusable, configurable components that can be leveraged in other designs.  These components are also intended as good examples of ROHD hardware implementations.

This project is a work in progress!  Initial components are primarily focused on correctness, and there is room for optimization from there.  Please feel free to contribute or provide feedback.  Check out [`CONTRIBUTING`](https://github.com/intel/rohd-hcl/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute.

This project is *not* intended to be the *only* place for reusable hardware components developed in ROHD.  It's not even intended to be the only *library*.  Contributions are welcomed to this library, but developers are also welcome to build independent packages or libraries, even if they may overlap.

## Guidelines for Components

- All components should be `Module`s so that they are convertible to SystemVerilog
- Components should be general and easily reusable
- Components should be as configurable as may be useful
- Components must be extensively tested
- Components must have excellent documentation and examples
- The first component in a category should be the simplest
- Focus on breadth of component types before depth in one type
- Add `extension`s to other classes to make component usage easier, when appropriate

## Component List
