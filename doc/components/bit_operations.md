# Bit Operations

The following components complement the [count](count.md), [find](find.md), and
[rotate](rotate.md) modules. They are exported by
`package:rohd_hcl/rohd_hcl.dart`.

## Bitwise Population Count

`XorPopcount(a, b)` counts differing bit positions and `XnorPopcount(a, b)`
counts equal positions. Inputs must have equal widths; both expose `count` and
the underlying count tree's `treeDepth`.

## Leading and Trailing Zeros

`CountLeadingZeros(inp)` and `CountTrailingZeros(inp)` expose the number of
zeros from the most- or least-significant end on `count`. For an all-zero input,
the result is the input width.

## Multiplexers

`OneHotMux(selector, cases)` combines every selected case with bitwise OR. No
selected bits produce zero; multiple selected bits OR the selected words.
`PriorityMux` selects the lowest-index asserted selector bit or a supplied
default when none is asserted.

`BitwiseMux(selects, inputs)` makes an independent selection for each bit
position. Each select and input has the same width, with one select per input.
At each bit, selected inputs are ORed, so one-hot selection per bit is the
intended use.

## Padding and Bit Replacement

`Pad(inp, atLeast: n)` extends the input to at least `n` bits. It pads the
least-significant end by default; `lsbs: false` pads the other end, and `fill`
selects the inserted bit value. Inputs already at least `n` bits are unchanged.

`SetBits(inp, count)` sets a runtime-selected number of bits at one end to
`fill`; `lsbs` chooses the end and counts at or above the input width affect
every bit. `WithSet(subject, start, value)` overwrites a runtime-selected range.
Bits above the subject width are discarded, and a start at or beyond that width
leaves the subject unchanged.
