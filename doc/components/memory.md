# Memory

ROHD-HCL provides a generic `abstract` [`Memory`](https://intel.github.io/rohd-hcl/rohd_hcl/Memory-class.html) class which accepts a dynamic number of `writePorts` and `readPorts`, where each port is of type [`DataPortInterface`](https://intel.github.io/rohd-hcl/rohd_hcl/DataPortInterface-class.html).  A `DataPortInterface` is a simple interface with `en` and `addr` as `control` signals and `data` signal(s).  In a write interface, all signals are in the same direction.  In a read interface, the `control` signals are in the opposite direction of the `data` signal(s).

## Masks

A sub-class of `DataPortInterface` is the[`MaskedDataPortInterface`](https://intel.github.io/rohd-hcl/rohd_hcl/MaskedDataPortInterface-class.html), which adds `mask` to the `data` group of signals.  The `mask` signal is a byte-enable signal, where each bit of `mask` controls one byte of `data`.

## Register Files

A sub-class of `Memory` is the [`RegisterFile`](https://intel.github.io/rohd-hcl/rohd_hcl/RegisterFile-class.html), which inherits the same flexible interface from `Memory`.  It has a configurable number of entries via `numEntries`.

The `RegisterFile` accepts masks on writes, but not on reads.

Currently, `RegisterFile` only generates flop-based memory (no latches).

The read path is combinational, so data is provided immediately according to the control signals.

## Memory Models

The `MemoryModel` has the same interface as a `Memory`, but is non-synthesizable and uses a software-based `SparseMemoryStorage` as a backing for data storage. This is a useful tool for testing systems that have relatively large memories.
